Unary operators: Operators that work on just one operand. Examples of unary 
operators are negation (-x, which returns the negative of x) and increment (x++, 
which adds 1 to x)
• Binary operators Ternary operators:
You can use the increment and decrement operators only on variables — not on 
numeric literals or other expressions. 
The increment and decrement operators are unusual because they are unary 
operators that can be placed either before (prefix) or after (postfix)the variable they 
apply to. Whether you place the operator before or after the variable can have 
a major effect on how an expression is evaluated. If you place an increment or 
decrement operator before its variable, the operator is applied before the rest of 
the expression is evaluated.
A compound assignment operator is an operator that performs a calculation and an 
assignment at the same time.
