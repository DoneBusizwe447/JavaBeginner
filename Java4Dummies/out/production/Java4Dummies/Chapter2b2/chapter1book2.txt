public: 
A keyword of the Java language that indicates that the element 
that follows should be made available to other Java elements. 

class: Another Java keyword that indicates that the element being 
defined here is a class. All Java programs are made up of one or more
classes. A class definition contains code that defines the behavior of the
objects created and used by the program

public: The public keyword is used again, this time to indicate that a 
method being declared here should have public access

The state of an object consists of any data that the object might be keeping track of, and the behavior consists of actions that the object can perform. The 
behaviors are represented in the class by one or more methods that can be called 
on to perform actions.

The difference between a class and an object is similar to the difference between a 
blueprint and a house. A blueprint is a plan for a house. A house is an implementation of a blueprint. One set of blueprints can be used to build many houses. Likewise, a class is a plan for an object, and an object is — in Java terms — an instance
of a class. You can use a single class to create more than one object.
